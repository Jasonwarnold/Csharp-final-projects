 C# final projects

This claas final consisted of 3 projects:
Twenty-One:

The user rolls dice in an attempt to hit exactly 21.  If the user goes over 21, they lose.  If they hit 21 exactly, they win.  Pop up a MessageBox that informs the user if they win or lose.  Then they can play the game again if they want by clicking on a “Play Again” button.

At first the user should roll 2 dice.  Once their total hits 15 or above, they should only roll one dice.  (Use a random number generator to simulate the dice rolls.

Build a GUI to display all the Game Data back to the user.  Maybe include a roll button that the user can press to roll the dice.  Also maybe include a button that says “Play Again,” that the user can press to play the game another time. Maybe an “Exit” Button as well. 

Also use Images of the dice to display when the user rolls.  That is if the user roll is suppose to be a 6 and and a 3, display an image of a 3 die and a 6 die.  2 images for two dice and only one image whne the user only rolls one die.

Guessing Game:
Write a program to implement the Number Guessing Game. The main method should loop as long as the player wants to play the game again.  
Write a method called PlayGame().  In this method write the code to play the game.  In the game the computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. Each time the player enters a guess, the computer tells the player whether the guess is too high, too low, or right. Once the player guesses the number, that game is over.  Keep track of how many guesses it takes the player to get the number correct.

Craps:

Write a method called PlayCraps().  In this method write the code to play the game.  How the game works: The user rolls 2 dice.  If the dice lands on 7 or 11. The user wins.  If the dice land on 2, 3 or 12, the user loses.  If any other number comes up, like 9, that number becomes the point.  The user will next roll as many times as necessary to either hit their point(9), they win, or they hit a 7, they lose.  If any other number comes up, like a 5, the user rolls again….until they hit their point or a 7. 

The main method should ask the user if they want to play again, and loop as long as the user wants to play again.

All code for this project was developed by myself.
